# flappy bird game for college written in lua 

i absolutley hate lua, its been known amongst my freinds that i dispise lua.
and that got me thinking why? maybe because of the speed, the syntax or maybe juss the name lua.
It seems ill never know why.

anyway tangent aside heres a small game i made in corona sdk as apart of a project "heavily inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjxJDW6LSEU "
because i didnt know how flappy bird works and i didnt want to put in the effort to learn lua but i had to learn some stuff about it anyway

## side note

why do colleges want you to code in lua it makes no sense at all like why ami being forced to use a "second tier langauge"
when i can make a far more efficent and honestly better game in rust, c or c++. maybe its the fact that no compsci
teacher now adays knows how to write code so they use a langauge like lua witch looks to me from a lower level langauge dev
as sudo code with extra steps.

i mean why get into the field if your not gonna learn the most prolific part about compsci, which is using your knowlege to
write software that can do actual stuff.
